# Branching

Branching is a way to work on different versions of a repository at one time

Anything in the master branch is always *deployable*

# Pull Request

A pull request is a way in GitHub to say you’re proposing a change to a repo. 

The change you’re proposing is visible to all developers working on that repo.
