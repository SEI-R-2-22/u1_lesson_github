  - Use GitHub to save your code

## Lesson Instructions

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 

It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

GitHub is where you upload your code.

GitHub is where others can see and download your code.

### What is a GitHub repository?

Pronounced *re·pos·i·to·ry*, but called *repo* for short.

It’s the place where your code is stored.

### Branching

Branching is a way to work on different versions of a repository at the same time.

Anything in the "main" branch is always *deployable*.

### Pull Requests

A *pull request* is a way in GitHub to say you’re proposing a change to a repo.

The change you’re proposing is visible to all developers working on that repo.

### Cloning

When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a *remote* repository. 

You can clone a repository to create a *local* copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.

### Forking

Creating a “fork” is producing a personal copy of someone else’s project.

### GitHub Flow

GitHub Flow is a workflow you use to collaborate with other developers on a GitHub project.
